h2. Mapping RDF to Neo4j

RDF triple consist of subject, predicate and object. 
* Subjects in rdf triples are URIs or blank nodes.
* All predicates are URIs.
* Objects can be URIs, blank nodes or literal values. 

When mapping RDF to Neo4j following points are taken in considertaion:
* Each neo4j node has a label which can be *uri* , *literal* and *bnode*.
* Nodes having label *uri* and *bnode* have one property (key-value pair)
** uri
* Nodes having label *literal* have three properties
** value 
** datatype
** lang

Follwing figure shows an RDF resource having URI <http://seecs.edu.pk/db885#AmirHayat> and demostrats how this resource is modeled in Neo4j.
