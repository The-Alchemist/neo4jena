How to use Neo4Jena?
--------------------

Create a Jena model and read RDF file/triples in it.

```
Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();

InputStream in = FileManager.get().open( inputFileName );

model.read(in,"","TTL"); { Alternatively model.read(in,"","RDF") }
```

For initialization of NeoGraph there are two constructors.
* public NeoGraph(final String directory)
* public NeoGraph(final GraphDatabaseService graphdb)

After initialization an instance of NeoGraph is created. Then create a Jena model for graph and pass NeoGraph instance as parameter.

```
Model njmodel = ModelFactory.createModelForGraph(graph);
```

Load triples from model into njmodel.

```
njmodel.add(model);
```

For optimization purpose, call NeoGraph method startBulkLoad() before loading triples and stopBulkLoad() after loading is finished.
